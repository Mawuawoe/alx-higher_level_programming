1. Write a function that prints x number of elements of a list. 
-->my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
-->x represents the number of elements to print
-->x can be bigger than the length of my_list
--> Returns the real number of elements printed
--> You have to use try: / except:

2. Write a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().

-->Prototype: def safe_print_integer(value):
-->value can be any type (integer, string, etc.)
-->The integer should be printed followed by a new line
-->Returns True if value has been correctly printed (it means the value is an integer)
-->Otherwise, returns False
-->You have to use try: / except:
-->You have to use "{:d}".format() to print as integer
-->You are not allowed to import any module
-->You are not allowed to use type()
